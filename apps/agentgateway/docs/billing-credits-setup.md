# Astrail Billing and Credits Setup

Use this checklist before taking real customers through checkout.

## Product Rules

Astrail sells monthly workspace plans. Each plan includes monthly credits plus hard safety limits for hosted endpoints, MCP generations, and runtime tool calls.

| Plan | Price | Monthly credits | Tool calls | Generations | Hosted endpoints |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Free | $0/mo | 500 | 50 | 1 | 1 |
| Launch | $19/mo | 25,000 | 20,000 | 25 | 5 |
| Scale | $99/mo | 250,000 | 200,000 | 150 | 25 |

Credit costs:

| Action | Credits | Charged when |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Runtime tool call | 1 | A hosted MCP endpoint accepts a valid `tools/call` request. |
| OpenAPI MCP generation | 250 | A successful OpenAPI/docs-to-MCP endpoint is saved. |
| Website to MCP inspection | 500 | A successful Website-to-MCP endpoint is saved. |
| SDK export | 100 | A downloadable SDK/docs bundle is built for a generated server. |
| Hosted endpoint slot | 0 | Enforced as a plan limit, not a credit charge. |

Not charged:

- failed OpenAPI discovery
- failed validation
- invalid JSON-RPC
- auth failures
- rate-limit failures
- `initialize`
- `tools/list`
- duplicate SDK re-downloads for the same server inside the current billing period

## Required Supabase Tables

Run `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. If you already ran the older runtime schema, also run:

```bash
supabase-migration-billing.sql
```

Then verify:

```bash
npm run verify:schema
```

The verifier checks:

- `billing_webhook_events`
- `billing_subscriptions`
- `billing_payment_events`
- `billing_usage`
- protected RLS for subscriptions and usage
- runtime observability tables used for credit metering

## Dodo Payments Environment

Set these in Vercel for Production:

```txt
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=<live API key>
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=live_mode
DODO_PRODUCT_LAUNCH=<Launch $19/mo subscription product id>
DODO_PRODUCT_SCALE=<Scale $99/mo subscription product id>
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY=<webhook signing secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://astrail.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://astrail.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_RUNTIME_BASE_URL=https://astrail.dev
```

For test mode:

```txt
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=<test API key>
DODO_PRODUCT_LAUNCH=<test Launch subscription product id>
DODO_PRODUCT_SCALE=<test Scale subscription product id>
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY=<test webhook signing secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_RUNTIME_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Do not create a `NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY`; Dodo API and webhook secrets must stay server-side.

`DODO_PRODUCT_BUILDER`, `DODO_PRODUCT_STARTER`, `DODO_PRODUCT_PRO`, `DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_LAUNCH`, `DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_BUILDER`, `DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_STARTER`, and `DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_PRO` are accepted as Launch aliases for older deployments, but new Vercel projects should use `DODO_PRODUCT_LAUNCH`.

`DODO_PRODUCT_TEAM` and `DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_TEAM` are accepted as Scale aliases for older deployments, but new Vercel projects should use `DODO_PRODUCT_SCALE`.

The checkout API sends metadata with:

- `source=astrail`
- `plan`
- `plan_name`
- `monthly_credits`
- `monthly_tool_calls`
- `monthly_generations`
- `hosted_endpoints`
- `user_id`
- `email`

The webhook stores the raw event in `billing_webhook_events`, stores payment events in `billing_payment_events`, and upserts workspace entitlement state in `billing_subscriptions`.

## Webhook URL

Configure this endpoint in Dodo:

```txt
https://astrail.dev/api/billing/webhook/dodo
```

For Vercel preview or local tunnel testing, use the matching deployment URL with the same path.

Subscribe the Dodo endpoint to these events:

- `subscription.active`
- `subscription.updated`
- `subscription.renewed`
- `subscription.plan_changed`
- `subscription.on_hold`
- `subscription.cancelled`
- `subscription.failed`
- `subscription.expired`
- `payment.succeeded`
- `payment.failed`

The webhook verifies Dodo's Standard Webhooks signature headers and stores the Dodo `webhook-id` in `billing_webhook_events`. Payment events are stored in `billing_payment_events`.

Paid plan access is granted only when Astrail has a payment-confirmed entitlement:

- `payment.succeeded` records `paid_confirmed_at` and can activate the paid plan.
- `subscription.active`, `subscription.updated`, and `subscription.renewed` update the subscription period and status, but remain `pending_payment` until a successful payment is recorded.
- `subscription.on_hold`, `subscription.cancelled`, `subscription.failed`, and `subscription.expired` set the entitlement inactive and move `profiles.plan` back to `free`.
- Older subscription webhooks are ignored when a newer `dodo_last_event_at` already exists, so out-of-order delivery cannot rewind a workspace to stale billing state.

## Checkout Flow

1. Visitor picks a plan on `/payment`.
2. Free routes to `/signup`.
3. Launch and Scale route to `/signup?plan=starter` or `/signup?plan=team`. The public plan id remains `starter` for backwards compatibility, but users see Launch.
4. Signup creates/signs in the user first.
5. After auth, paid plans redirect to `/dashboard/billing?plan=<plan>`.
6. The user clicks the plan CTA and `/api/billing/checkout` creates a Dodo checkout.
7. Dodo redirects back to `/dashboard/billing?checkout=complete&plan=<plan>`.
8. Dodo webhook records the successful payment and updates `billing_subscriptions.entitlement_status`.
9. `/api/billing/status` returns the active plan and usage summary.
10. Paid users can open Dodo Customer Portal through `/api/billing/portal` after the webhook stores their `dodo_customer_id`.

## Production Smoke Test

After env vars and webhook are configured:

```bash
npm run verify:env
npm run verify:schema
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Manual test:

1. Open `/payment`.
2. Choose Launch.
3. Create an account with Google or magic link.
4. Confirm you land on `/dashboard/billing?plan=starter`.
5. Click Upgrade.
6. Complete a test checkout.
7. Confirm `billing_payment_events` has a `payment.succeeded` row and `/api/billing/status` returns `plan: "starter"` with an active entitlement.
8. Generate endpoints until a limit is reached and confirm the API returns HTTP `402` with `billing` and `billingAction`.
9. Call a hosted MCP tool past the credit/tool-call limit and confirm the MCP response includes `billing_required`.

## Edge Cases

- If Dodo env vars are missing, checkout returns HTTP `503` and the UI shows a temporary billing message.
- If Supabase service role is missing, usage returns `enforcement: "unavailable"` and production should not launch.
- If `tool_call_logs` is unavailable but `mcp_servers.call_count` exists, enforcement uses `best_effort`.
- Failed generations are saved for diagnostics but excluded from successful generation credit usage.
- SDK exports write to `billing_usage` and are deduplicated per server per billing period.
- Paid checkout requires an authenticated workspace user so subscriptions map to a real `user_id`.
- Paid entitlements require `entitlement_status='active'`, a non-null `paid_confirmed_at`, and a non-expired billing period.
- Dodo one-time credit packs should wait until a dedicated credit ledger/top-up table is connected, so webhook retries cannot double-apply credits.
