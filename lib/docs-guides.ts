    intro:
      "Internal admin APIs are where MCP can save teams hours, and where loose tool design can hurt production. Build these tools around specific operational jobs, not generic admin power.",
    steps: [
      "Inventory admin endpoints by risk: read, write, destructive, permission-changing, and money-moving.",
      "Generate read tools for lookup, diagnostics, flags, job status, and audit history first.",
      "Wrap write tools with explicit ids, allowed fields, idempotency, actor identity, and reason fields.",
      "Test blocked dangerous endpoints, missing auth, invalid actor, duplicate request, and audit log creation.",
    ],
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Recommended tool surface",
        body: [
          "Internal admin MCP tools should map to operational tasks: look up user, inspect account flags, retry failed job, add admin note, or disable feature flag for one account. These tools are easier to audit than a generic admin API caller.",
          "Keep permission changes, bulk edits, deletes, impersonation, and production config changes out of the agent surface unless there is a human approval path.",
